##  Description

Favorita Stores Sales Prediction App
This web application allows users to predict sales for Favorita stores based on historical data using the Facebook Prophet machine learning model. Users can input a specific date, and the app will provide a sales prediction for that date.

Setup
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory.

Copy code
cd <project-directory>
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended).

Copy code
python -m venv myenv
Activate the virtual environment.

On Windows:

Copy code
myenv\Scripts\activate
On macOS and Linux:

Copy code
source myenv/bin/activate
Install the required packages.

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Streamlit app.

Copy code
streamlit run sales_prediction_app.py

The app will start a local web server, and you can access it by opening the provided URL in your browser.
