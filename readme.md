##  Description

Favorita Stores Sales Prediction App
This web application allows users to predict sales for Favorita stores based on historical data using the Facebook Prophet machine learning model. Users can input a specific date, and the app will provide a sales prediction for that date.

Setup
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

Clone this repository to your local machine.


git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory.


cd <project-directory>
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended).


python -m venv myenv
Activate the virtual environment.

On Windows:


myenv\Scripts\activate
On macOS and Linux:


source myenv/bin/activate
Install the required packages.


pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Streamlit app.


streamlit run sales_prediction_app.py

The app will start a local web server, and you can access it by opening the provided URL in your browser.

Once the app is loaded, you can select a specific date from the sidebar.

The app will then display the predicted sales for that date based on the historical data and the trained Prophet model.
